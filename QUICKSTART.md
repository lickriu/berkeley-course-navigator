## Install in 3 Minutes

### Step 1: Get the Extension

Download this folder to your computer (or clone if using git)

### Step 2: Load in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and type in the address bar: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Turn ON "Developer mode" (toggle switch in top-right)
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button
4. Select the `berkeley-course-navigator` folder
5. You should see "Berkeley Course Navigator" appear in your extensions list!

### Step 3: Test It!

Visit any Berkeley course page, for example:

```
https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2026-spring-compsci-61c-001-lec-001
```

You should see a blue overlay in the top-right corner! 🎉

## What You'll See

- **Top-right overlay** with course code (e.g., "COMPSCI 61C")
- **Year sections** (2024, 2025, 2026, etc.)
- **Semester buttons** (Spring, Summer, Fall) for each year
- **Blue highlight** on the current term you're viewing
- **Green checkmarks** appear on terms where the course is offered
- **Grayed out** terms where the course isn't available

## Tips

- Click any semester button to jump to that term (opens in new tab)
- Click the **−** button to minimize the overlay
- The extension automatically checks which terms the course is offered

## Troubleshooting

**Don't see the overlay?**

- Make sure you're on a course page (URL should be: classes.berkeley.edu/content/...)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that the extension is enabled in chrome://extensions/
